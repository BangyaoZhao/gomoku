# gomoku
See https://bangyaozhao.github.io/byzhao-gomoku.github.io/ for a computational-limited online version of the game. The online version does not support pytorch and is using an equivalent numpy version of the neural network. It only has 20 simulations per move, while on a desktop it can easily achieve 1000 simulations, even without a GPU.

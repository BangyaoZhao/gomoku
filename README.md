# gomoku
See https://bangyaozhao.github.io/gomoku.github.io/ for a computational-limited online version of the game. The online version does not support Pytorch and is using an equivalent numpy version of the neural network. It only uses 100 simulations per move, while on a desktop, it can easily achieve 1000 simulations, even without a GPU.
